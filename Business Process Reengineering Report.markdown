## 1. Executive Summary
This report outlines the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) of our Final Year Project (FYP), "COVID-19 Detection Using Lung X-Ray Images." Our goal was to transform the traditional manual process of diagnosing COVID-19 through X-ray images into an automated, AI-powered system. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a Flask-based web application, we created a fast, accurate, and user-friendly tool for doctors and clinics, especially in remote areas.  

The reengineered system achieved a 99.54% accuracy rate in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images, reduced diagnosis time to 10–15 seconds, and improved accessibility through a web interface. We analyzed the old manual process, identified inefficiencies (like delays and human errors), and redesigned it with automation and scalability in mind. The project was tested thoroughly, deployed successfully, and supported with user manuals and training guides. Despite challenges like limited datasets, we overcame them using data augmentation and open-source tools. This system not only helps fight COVID-19 but can also be adapted for other diseases, making healthcare diagnostics more efficient and reliable.

## 2. Introduction
Our FYP, "COVID-19 Detection Using Lung X-Ray Images," aimed to make COVID-19 diagnosis faster and more accurate using AI. In this BPR report, we treat the project as a reengineering effort to improve how healthcare providers diagnose COVID-19. The old way—manual X-ray analysis by radiologists—was slow, prone to errors, and hard to scale in remote areas. Our project replaces this with an automated system that uses a CNN model to analyze X-rays and a web app to deliver results.

**Goals**:  
- Create a fast, accurate, and accessible COVID-19 detection tool.  
- Reduce diagnosis time and human errors.  
- Make the system easy for doctors to use, even in areas with limited resources.  

**Scope**:  
- Develop a web-based system for X-ray uploads and results.  
- Train a CNN model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy.  
- Ensure the system is scalable, reliable, and user-friendly.  

**Objectives**:  
- Achieve at least 95% detection accuracy (achieved 99.54%).  
- Process X-rays in 10–15 seconds.  
- Build a simple interface for doctors and admins.  
- Support remote clinics with minimal hardware needs.  

This report explains how we analyzed the old process, designed a new system, implemented it, and ensured it works well for healthcare providers.

## 3. Business Process Analysis
### Current Process
Before our system, diagnosing COVID-19 from X-rays involved these steps:  
1. A patient gets an X-ray at a clinic.  
2. A radiologist manually reviews the X-ray to spot signs of COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities).  
3. The radiologist writes a report and sends it to the doctor.  
4. The doctor decides on treatment based on the report.  

### Inefficiencies
- **Time-Consuming**: Manual analysis takes 10–30 minutes per X-ray, delaying treatment.  
- **Human Errors**: Tired or inexperienced radiologists may misinterpret images.  
- **Limited Access**: Remote areas lack skilled radiologists, making diagnosis hard.  
- **Scalability Issues**: During pandemics, hospitals can’t handle high volumes of X-rays.  
- **Costly**: Hiring radiologists and maintaining equipment is expensive.  

### Reengineering Goals
We wanted to fix these problems by:  
- **Automating Analysis**: Use a CNN model to detect COVID-19 instantly.  
- **Reducing Errors**: Achieve high accuracy (99.54%) to match or beat human performance.  
- **Improving Access**: Build a web app that works on any device with a browser.  
- **Scaling Up**: Allow multiple users to upload X-rays at once without delays.  
- **Cutting Costs**: Use open-source tools like TensorFlow and Flask to keep it affordable.  

### New Process
1. A doctor uploads an X-ray to our web app.  
2. The system preprocesses the image (resizing, normalizing).  
3. The CNN model analyzes the X-ray and predicts COVID-19 (Positive/Negative) with a probability score.  
4. The result is displayed in 10–15 seconds, and the doctor can view past results in a history log.  

This new process is faster, more accurate, and works anywhere with internet access.

## 4. System Requirements
Based on our FYP documentation (Chapter 3), we defined requirements to ensure the system meets healthcare needs. These are split into functional (what the system does) and non-functional (how it performs).

### Functional Requirements
- **User Registration**: Doctors register with name, email, and password (Table 3.1).  
- **User Login**: Doctors log in to access the system (Table 3.2).  
- **Forgot Password**: Doctors reset passwords via email (Table 3.3).  
- **Upload X-Ray**: Doctors upload JPEG/PNG X-rays for analysis (Table 3.4).  
- **COVID-19 Detection**: The system analyzes X-rays and shows results (Table 3.5).  
- **View History**: Doctors see past detection results (Table 3.6).  
- **Admin Login**: Admins log in to manage the system.  
- **Manage Users**: Admins add, update, or delete doctor accounts (Table 3.8).  
- **Manage Dataset**: Admins upload datasets for training (Table 3.9).  
- **Train Model**: Admins retrain the CNN model (Table 7.7).  
- **Contact Us**: Users send inquiries via a form (Table 7.9).  
- **Chatbot**: Answers questions about COVID-19 and system use (Table 7.10).  

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability**: Simple interface, no technical skills needed.  
- **Performance**: Results in 10–15 seconds, reset links in 5–10 seconds.  
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime, 95%+ accuracy (achieved 99.54%).  
- **Security**: Encrypted data, expiring reset tokens.  
- **Scalability**: Handles 50+ concurrent users.  
- **Portability**: Works on any browser (Chrome, Firefox) and OS.  
- **Maintainability**: Modular code for easy updates.  
- **Design Constraints**: Runs on standard servers (8GB RAM, dual-core CPU).  

These requirements guided our design to ensure the system is practical and effective for clinics.

## 5. System Design
We designed the system to be simple, scalable, and aligned with BPR goals. Below are the key design elements, based on FYP documentation (Chapter 6).

### System Architecture
The system follows a client-server model (Figure 1.1):  
- **Client**: Web browser where doctors upload X-rays and view results.  
- **Server**: Flask backend that handles requests, runs the CNN model, and stores data.  
- **Database**: SQLite stores user info, X-rays, and detection history.  
- **CNN Model**: Processes X-rays and predicts COVID-19 (Figure 1.2).  

### Database Schema
The Entity Relationship Diagram (Figure 6.13) includes:  
- **Users**: Stores doctor details (ID, name, email, password).  
- **Admins**: Stores admin credentials.  
- **X-Rays**: Stores uploaded images and metadata (ID, user ID, upload date).  
- **Results**: Stores detection results (ID, X-ray ID, result, probability).  
- **Datasets**: Stores training datasets for the CNN model.  

### Workflows
- **Upload Workflow**: User uploads X-ray → System preprocesses → CNN predicts → Result stored and displayed (Figure 6.6, 6.7).  
- **Admin Workflow**: Admin logs in → Manages users/datasets → Trains model (Figure 6.10, 6.11).  
- **Security Workflow**: Forgot password → Email reset link → Update password (Figure 6.5).  

### UML Diagrams
- **Use Case Diagram**: Shows user and admin actions (Figure 6.1).  
- **Class Diagram**: Defines system entities and relationships (Figure 6.2).  
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Detail workflows like registration, login, and detection (Figures 6.3–6.12).  

This design ensures the system is modular, easy to maintain, and meets all requirements.
